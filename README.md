Solution Overview
The solution is structured around Clean Architecture, which emphasizes separation of concerns and independence of frameworks, UI, and infrastructure. It ensures that the core business logic is independent of external dependencies, making the application maintainable, testable, and scalable.

Key Concepts
1.	Clean Architecture Principles:
•	Core Independence: The core domain (entities, use cases) is independent of frameworks, databases, or UI.
•	Separation of Concerns: Each layer has a specific responsibility.
•	Dependency Inversion: High-level modules (business logic) should not depend on low-level modules (infrastructure). Both should depend on abstractions.
2.	Layered Architecture:
•	Domain Layer: Contains core business logic and entities.
•	Application Layer: Contains use cases, commands, queries, and interfaces for interacting with the domain.
•	Infrastructure Layer: Handles database access, external services, and other low-level concerns.
•	Presentation Layer: Handles UI or API endpoints.
3.	CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):
•	Commands (e.g., CreateCategoryCommand) modify state.
•	Queries (e.g., GetAllCategoriesQueryHandler) retrieve data.
4.	Entity Framework Core:
•	Used for database access and object-relational mapping (ORM).
•	Includes features like migrations, seeding, and change tracking.
5.	MediatR:
•	A library for implementing the Mediator Pattern.
•	Decouples the sender and receiver of requests (e.g., commands and queries).
6.	Unit Testing:
•	Ensures the correctness of individual components (e.g., entities, handlers).
•	Uses libraries like XUnit and FluentAssertions.
7.	Dependency Injection:
•	Dependencies are injected into constructors, adhering to the Dependency Inversion Principle.
8.	Request/Response Handling:
•	Standardized request/response models are used, such as BaseResponse<T> and PagedResponse<T>.
9.	Behavioral Pipelines:
•	Middleware-like behaviors (e.g., validation, exception handling) are implemented using MediatR pipeline behaviors.

7.	Exception Handling:
•	Centralized exception handling is implemented in the API layer.

Best Practices for Managing Namespaces
1.	Follow the Project Structure:
•	Namespaces should reflect the folder structure of your project. This makes it easier to locate files and understand their purpose.
•	For example, if a file is in the Domain/Common folder, its namespace should be CleanArchitectureApp.Domain.Common.
2.	Group Common Usages:
•	If multiple files share the same set of common namespaces, you can create a global using directive in .NET 6+ to avoid repetitive using statements in each file.
3.	Avoid Overly Broad Namespaces:
•	Avoid creating a single namespace like CleanArchitectureApp.Common for everything. This can lead to clutter and make it harder to understand the purpose of individual files.
4.	Use global using Directives:
•	In .NET 6+, you can define common namespaces in a single file (e.g., GlobalUsings.cs) and make them available across the entire project.
5.	Keep Domain-Specific Namespaces:
•	Keep namespaces specific to their domain or layer (e.g., Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Shared). This aligns with the principles of Clean Architecture.
How to Apply This in Your Project
Step 1: Identify Common Namespaces
In your current context, the following namespaces are commonly used across multiple files:
•	System
•	System.Collections.Generic
•	System.Linq
•	System.Text
•	System.Threading.Tasks
Step 2: Create a GlobalUsings.cs File
In .NET 6+, you can create a GlobalUsings.cs file in the root of your project (or in a folder like Common or Shared) and define the common namespaces there.
Step 4: Keep Layer-Specific Namespaces
For domain-specific or layer-specific namespaces (e.g., CleanArchitectureApp.Domain.Common), keep them as they are. These namespaces provide context about the file's purpose and location in the architecture.

Benefits of Using global using Directives
1.	Reduces Boilerplate Code:
•	Eliminates repetitive using statements in every file.
2.	Improves Readability:
•	Makes files cleaner and easier to read.
3.	Centralized Management:
•	Common namespaces are managed in one place, making it easier to update them if needed.

When Not to Use global using
•	File-Specific Dependencies:
•	If a namespace is only used in a single file, it's better to include it locally rather than globally.
•	Avoid Polluting the Global Scope:
•	Be cautious about adding too many global usings, as it can lead to ambiguity or conflicts.
